Donation Tracker Application 

What is it?
The Donation Tracker with Heap is a Java console application designed to manage and prioritize monetary donations. It uses a heap structure (via Java's PriorityQueue) to keep track of donations, ensuring that the highest donations are always accessible for acknowledgment or processing first.

What It Can Do
1. Add a Donation: Users can input a contributor's name and the amount of their donation, which will be stored in a priority queue.
2. View Highest Donation: Displays the largest donation in the system without removing it from the queue.
3. Remove Highest Donation: Removes the largest donation from the system (e.g., after it has been processed or acknowledged).
4. View All Donations: Lists all donations in order of amount, from highest to lowest.
5. Exit: Allows users to exit the application safely.

Why This Application Was Made
This application was created to solve a real-world problem of efficiently managing donations, especially in scenarios where large amounts require immediate attention (e.g., charity events, disaster relief funds). By utilizing a heap structure, the application ensures that the largest donations are handled first, which is critical for funding significant initiatives or recognizing major contributors.

How It contributes to me and to the community
The Donation Tracker enhances your programming skills by applying data structures like heaps to solve real-world problems. It teaches efficient resource prioritization and improves your understanding of Java concepts and encouraging generosity: Highlights large donations, motivating others to contribute more.
